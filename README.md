## About Me

I'm a plant biologist with broad experience in molecular genetics, biochemistry, crop physiology, and trait characterization in both controlled environment and field contexts. I'm currently a student in CU Boulder's Applied Computer Science Postbacc program and am pivoting onto a computational biology track. I created this page to track goals and progress as I work thorugh the program. You can find more details about my progress in the sections below!

### Summer 2024 Professional Development Status Updates

This summer, I enrolled in a special section of CSPB's Professional Development course focused on developing a project to build profiency with C++ in preparation to take Data Structures and Algorithms in the fall. As part of this course, I tracked goals and progress for weekly standup meetings below:

### Week 1 (5/20/24-5/26/24)

**Progress to Date**

- Reviewed all orientation materials on Moodle
- Created personal Github page to publish status updates

**Goals for Next Week**

- My current objective is to define my primary goal for the summer: am I mainly building fluency with C++ to limit the risk of juggling unfamiliar coding frameworks and new math concepts simultaneously in the fall, or am I pursuing a dual purpose project that will accomplish the former goal and teach me something useful that I can carry forward onto the data science track?

**Successess & Challenges**

- Setting up a Github page was new to me and entailed a bit of a learning curve.
- All of my prior data science/comp bio experience has only involved Python and R; I'm currently doing some exploratory research to understand the utility of delving deeply into C++ if I want to stay on this track.
